The channel capacity is limited, and congestion control regulates the number of messages that can enter the medium. With user rate growing, overloading becomes a factor that might affect road safety and traffic efficiency. The present paper evaluates the potential of using Radar-Based Communication (RadCom) for offloading the V2X spectrum. We consider a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) platooning scenario as a case of maneuver coordination where local messages are transmitted by means of RadCom at different penetration rates. Simulations show significant improvements in channel occupation and network reliability. As a result, RadCom allows for shorter safe and energy efficient inter-vehicle distances.","sentences":["V2X communications are nowadays performed at 5.9\\,GHz spectrum, either using WiFi-based or Cellular technology.","The channel capacity is limited, and congestion control regulates the number of messages that can enter the medium.","With user rate growing, overloading becomes a factor that might affect road safety and traffic efficiency.","The present paper evaluates the potential of using Radar-Based Communication (RadCom) for offloading the V2X spectrum.","We consider a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) platooning scenario as a case of maneuver coordination where local messages are transmitted by means of RadCom at different penetration rates.","Simulations show significant improvements in channel occupation and network reliability.","As a result, RadCom allows for shorter safe and energy efficient inter-vehicle distances."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09242v2"}
