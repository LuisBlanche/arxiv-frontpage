For signal and corruption with structured priors (e.g., sparsity, low-rankness), our uniform error rate for constrained Lasso typically coincides with the non-uniform one [Sun, Cui and Liu, 2022] up to logarithmic factors. By contrast, our uniform error rate for unconstrained Lasso exhibits worse dependence on the structured parameters due to regularization parameters larger than the ones for non-uniform recovery. For signal and corruption living in the ranges of some Lipschitz continuous generative models (referred to as generative priors), we achieve uniform recovery via constrained Lasso with a measurement number proportional to the latent dimensions of the generative models. Our treatments to the two kinds of priors are (nearly) unified and share the common key ingredients of (global) quantized product embedding (QPE) property, which states that the dithered uniform quantization (universally) preserves inner product.

By constructing a set of semantic regulations in this representation, we achieve joint optimization of blendshapes and expression coefficients. Furthermore, to enable a user-friendly multi-view setup with unsynchronized cameras, we propose a neural regressor to model time-varying motion parameters. This approach implicitly considers the time difference across multiple cameras, enhancing the accuracy of motion modeling. Experiments demonstrate that, with the flexible input of single or sparse multi-view videos, we reconstruct personalized high-fidelity blendshapes.

However, deploying GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput. We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training.","sentences":["In large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the Mixture of Experts paradigm has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing model expressiveness and accuracy.","However, deploying GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation.","This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources.","In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models.","We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity.","Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation.","By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls.","By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity.","We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency.","Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput.","We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08383v1"}

This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed \"Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics\" (UnMix-TNS).

Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs' capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoTBench, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy.

In this work, a professional biaxial compression device was used as a control setup to study the accuracy with which material properties can be estimated by two standard parallel jaw grippers and a force/torque sensor mounted at the robot wrist. Using three sets of deformable objects, different parameters were varied to observe their effect on measuring material characteristics: (1) repeated compression cycles, (2) compression speed, and (3) the surface area of the gripper jaws. Gripper effort versus position curves were obtained and transformed into stress/strain curves. The modulus of elasticity was estimated at different strain points. Viscoelasticity was assessed using the energy absorbed in a compression/decompression cycle, the Kelvin-Voigt, and Hunt-Crossley models. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) better results were obtained with slower compression speeds, while additional compression cycles or surface area did not improve estimation; (2) the robot grippers, even after calibration, were found to have a limited capability of delivering accurate estimates of absolute values of Young's modulus and viscoelasticity; (3) relative ordering of material characteristics was largely consistent across different grippers; (4) despite the nonlinear characteristics of deformable objects, fitting linear stress/strain approximations led to more stable results than local estimates of Young's modulus; (5) to assess viscoelasticity, the Hunt-Crossley model worked best.

VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints.

Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis. For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image. The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment.","sentences":["Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of robot navigation and localization systems that allows them to identify a place using only image data.","VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints.","Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings, and therefore combining multiple techniques can achieve more reliable VPR performance.","Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets.","Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis.","For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image.","The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08263v1"}

Offshore locations for wind turbines are increasingly exploited because of their numerous advantages. However, offshore wind farms require high investment in maintenance service. Due to its complexity and special requirements, maintenance service is usually outsourced by wind farm owners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine, quantify, and reduce the possible conflicts of interest between owners and maintenance suppliers. We created a complete techno-economic model to address this problem from an impartial point of view. An iterative process was developed to obtain statistical results that can help stakeholders negotiate the terms of the contract, in which the availability of the wind farm is the reference parameter by which to determine penalisations and incentives. Moreover, a multi-objective programming problem was addressed that maximises the profits of both parties without losing the alignment of their interests. The main scientific contribution of this paper is the maintenance analysis of offshore wind farms from two perspectives: that of the owner and the maintenance supplier. This analysis evaluates the conflicts of interest of both parties.

The former was framed as a modular plant scenario that required choices between modifying parameter settings in a current module (Adapt) and replacing the module by another one (Exchange). The risk was higher for Adapt to harm the product and for Exchange to harm the plant.

A third group made decisions based on the same probabilities, but received a generic task framing (no-content group). We expected framing to affect risk integration, leading the content-same group to make different choices than the no-content group. Contrary to this hypothesis, these two groups were strikingly similar in their decision outcomes and strategies, but clearly differed from the content-different group.

Numerous solutions have been implemented to date, demonstrating their potential to improve forecasting. Among these, deep learning is perceived as a revolutionary approach in the field. However, despite their effectiveness, the noise present in the collected data remains a significant challenge. This noise has the potential to diminish the performance of these algorithms, leading to inaccurate predictions. In response to this, this study explores a novel feature engineering approach. This approach involves altering the data input shape in both Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and Autoregressive models for various forecasting horizons. The results reveal substantial enhancements in model resilience against noise resulting from step increases in data. The approach could achieve an impressive 83% accuracy in predicting unseen data up to the 24th steps. Furthermore, this method consistently provides high accuracy for short, mid, and long-term forecasts, outperforming the performance of individual models. These findings pave the way for further research on noise reduction strategies at different forecasting horizons through shape-wise feature engineering.","sentences":["Accurate prediction of wind speed and power is vital for enhancing the efficiency of wind energy systems.","Numerous solutions have been implemented to date, demonstrating their potential to improve forecasting.","Among these, deep learning is perceived as a revolutionary approach in the field.","However, despite their effectiveness, the noise present in the collected data remains a significant challenge.","This noise has the potential to diminish the performance of these algorithms, leading to inaccurate predictions.","In response to this, this study explores a novel feature engineering approach.","This approach involves altering the data input shape in both Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and Autoregressive models for various forecasting horizons.","The results reveal substantial enhancements in model resilience against noise resulting from step increases in data.","The approach could achieve an impressive 83% accuracy in predicting unseen data up to the 24th steps.","Furthermore, this method consistently provides high accuracy for short, mid, and long-term forecasts, outperforming the performance of individual models.","These findings pave the way for further research on noise reduction strategies at different forecasting horizons through shape-wise feature engineering."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08233v1"}

Despite ongoing advancements, many existing solutions lack the capability to globally capture temporal dynamics of the video data. In this study, we present a novel approach to NLVL that aims to address this issue. Our method involves the direct generation of a global 2D temporal map via a conditional denoising diffusion process, based on the input video and language query. The main challenges are the inherent sparsity and discontinuity of a 2D temporal map in devising the diffusion decoder. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-scale technique and develop an innovative diffusion decoder. Our approach effectively encapsulates the interaction between the query and video data across various time scales. Experiments on the Charades and DiDeMo datasets underscore the potency of our design.","sentences":["Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL), grounding phrases from natural language descriptions to corresponding video segments, is a complex yet critical task in video understanding.","Despite ongoing advancements, many existing solutions lack the capability to globally capture temporal dynamics of the video data.","In this study, we present a novel approach to NLVL that aims to address this issue.","Our method involves the direct generation of a global 2D temporal map via a conditional denoising diffusion process, based on the input video and language query.","The main challenges are the inherent sparsity and discontinuity of a 2D temporal map in devising the diffusion decoder.","To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-scale technique and develop an innovative diffusion decoder.","Our approach effectively encapsulates the interaction between the query and video data across various time scales.","Experiments on the Charades and DiDeMo datasets underscore the potency of our design."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08232v1"}

Theoretically, such singularity occurs when the Forward Jacobian-matrix determinant becomes zero (Type II). However, actual PRs could lose control owing to Type II singularities for determinant values near zero, but not zero, because manufacturing tolerances introduce errors that are complex to model due to their low repeatability.   Thus, using an actual 3UPS+RPU PR, this paper presents three contributions: i) a proximity detection index for Type II singularities based on the angle between two Output Twist Screws. The index can identify which kinematic chains contribute to the singularity. ii) an experimental benchmark to study Type II singularities. iii) PR configurations where the proposed index is zero and the Forward Jacobian determinant is not. In this last configuration, the findings show that the actual robot is unable to handle external actions applied to the PR.","sentences":["Parallel robots (PRs) have singular configurations where the robot gains at least one degree of freedom and loses control.","Theoretically, such singularity occurs when the Forward Jacobian-matrix determinant becomes zero (Type II).","However, actual PRs could lose control owing to Type II singularities for determinant values near zero, but not zero, because manufacturing tolerances introduce errors that are complex to model due to their low repeatability.

Existing methods of cross-domain recommendation mainly focus on overlapping scenarios by assuming users are totally or partially overlapped, which are taken as bridges to connect different domains. However, this assumption does not always hold since it is illegal to leak users' identity information to other domains. Conducting Non-overlapping MCR (NMCR) is challenging since 1) The absence of overlapping information prevents us from directly aligning different domains, and this situation may get worse in the MCR scenario. 2) The distribution between source and target domains makes it difficult for us to learn common information across domains. To overcome the above challenges, we focus on NMCR, and devise MCRPL as our solution. To address Challenge 1, we first learn shared domain-agnostic and domain-dependent prompts, and pre-train them in the pre-training stage. To address Challenge 2, we further update the domain-dependent prompts with other parameters kept fixed to transfer the domain knowledge to the target domain. We conduct experiments on five real-world domains, and the results show the advance of our MCRPL method compared with several recent SOTA baselines.","sentences":["Cross-domain Recommendation (CR) is the task that tends to improve the recommendations in the sparse target domain by leveraging the information from other rich domains.","Existing methods of cross-domain recommendation mainly focus on overlapping scenarios by assuming users are totally or partially overlapped, which are taken as bridges to connect different domains.","However, this assumption does not always hold since it is illegal to leak users' identity information to other domains.","Conducting Non-overlapping MCR (NMCR) is challenging since 1)","The absence of overlapping information prevents us from directly aligning different domains, and this situation may get worse in the MCR scenario.","2)","The distribution between source and target domains makes it difficult for us to learn common information across domains.","To overcome the above challenges, we focus on NMCR, and devise MCRPL as our solution.","To address Challenge 1, we first learn shared domain-agnostic and domain-dependent prompts, and pre-train them in the pre-training stage.","To address Challenge 2, we further update the domain-dependent prompts with other parameters kept fixed to transfer the domain knowledge to the target domain.","We conduct experiments on five real-world domains, and the results show the advance of our MCRPL method compared with several recent SOTA baselines."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08228v1"}
